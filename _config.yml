# About Block
aboutTitle: "LETTER FROM THE SECRETARY GENERAL"
letterContent: "Dear Delegates,\n

As the Secretary General of IIT Guwahati Model United Nations Conference (IITGMUN) 2018, I could not be more venerated to welcome you all on behalf of my passionate team to the most ambitious version of the IIT Guwahati Model United Nations Conference - Alcheringa yet.

Every year, IITGMUN endeavors to provide a simulated learning platform to like-minded folks with a zealous passion for debating, international diplomacy as well as politics, and deliberative problem-solving. As a learning conference, we prioritize the development of mindset for finding the solutions to pressing world issues by putting oneself in the shoes of a country's representative. We believe that the best way to learn about international diplomacy is by actually doing it. At its core, the IITGMUN Conference is planned, organized, and directed in its totality by a passionate team of IIT Guwahati students that hail from different academic and cultural backgrounds, bringing their unique experiences to the dais. Over the years, we have been successful in delivering thought-intensive conferences to novice as well as seasoned delegates.  

The contemporary world scenario has been dominated by disruptions, both positive and negative. While the former can serve as a driving force for the global growth engine, dealing with the latter requires meticulous planning and deliberation. As a proponent of this thought, we have handpicked three agendae for this winter and set the floor for discussion on the same.

Namely:
UNGA: Preparing for Trans-Arctic Seafaring: Resolving the Impasse over the North-West Passage

ECOSOC: Fulfilling UN Sustainable Development Goals in the Age of Artificial Intelligence

Lok Sabha : Elucidation of Privacy and its Consequences as a Right

All these agendae are the product of incessant discussions and brainstorming among the team members to deliver the most debatable and relevant global quandaries to the participants. The selectivity of these agendae itself reflects our commitment to deliver the best we possibly can and traverse beyond the conventional line of thought.
  
We as a generation have the best time and resources, enumerated with the experience of older generations, to shape the world in a way we want. The onus is on us to act and deliberate as the choices of today will be governing the future in an unprecedented manner.

With an abyssal optimism, I leave you with the mantle and ask you to take part in an event that awaits a brilliant ensemble of delegates who dare to take on upcoming challenges in the world with courage and diplomacy. Wishing you all the very best of luck for the conference.

Sincerely,
Paridhi Kothari
Secretary General
IIT Guwahati Model UN Conference

# Team Block
teamBlockTitle: "About us"
aboutUs: "The MUN, or the Model United Nations, is a simulation of the actual UN. The participants pretend to represent a nation, and come to together to discuss the very same issues being debated upon in the UN. This gives a normal person the opportunity to know what’s its like to stand for something more than himself/herself, and to experience the complicated the verbal dance and that politicians and delegates take part in everyday. The MUN is a conclave for ideation by the fresh minds of our nation, to brainstorm solutions to problems plaguing our world. Participants work through the tenuous relationships between nations as they deliberate towards a resolution – and they get to look
nice in a suit and tie while they do it!"

lok-sabha-agenda-text: "Ethics of Euthanasia in Contemporary Indian Society"
about-lok-sabha-text: "Lok Sabha is composed of representatives of the people chosen by direct election on the basis of the adult suffrage..."
lok-sabha-popup-text-about: "The Lok Sabha, which literally translates to ‘House of the People’ is the lower house of India's bicameral Parliament, the upper house being the Rajya Sabha. It has the power to pass bills on legislative, financial, executive, constitutional, electoral as well as judicial matters.’The Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in Lok Sabha’, as well as occasional ‘Directions issued by the Speaker’ regulate the procedure in Lok Sabha."
lok-sabha-popup-text-agenda: "World over, there is ambiguity in forming legislation for euthanasia. There exist many narratives regarding this topic which span across varied regions of the world and through different periods. The current legislation in our country is still very dicey when it comes to euthanasia. A lot of it is driven by socio-economic and political factors. It becomes important to discuss this as it deals with human rights at large. This committee seeks to answer burning questions like who decides the value of life, when does a being ‘get a life’, can Right to Life supersede the Right to Die with Dignity, and so on. Join us in this debate which could be the turning stone for human rights legislation in our country."

unga-popup-text-about: "The General Assembly (GA) is the main policy making and representative organ of the UN. Decisions on important questions, such as those on peace and security, admission of new members and budgetary matters, require a two-thirds majority. Decisions on other questions are by simple majority. Each of the 193 member states of the United Nations has equal representation. The Assembly adopts its own rules of procedure and elects a President for each session."
unga-popup-text-agenda: "Where will you be when the seas rise and the waves wash over our megacities? What will you do when the air becomes so toxic that people won’t be able to survive breathing it? What will you say about your failure to your descendants when the world ends?All throughout human history, as much as we’ve thought about our past and how we came to be, we’ve also thought about our future- how we’re going to end. Is it going to be an asteroid strike? Will it be a volcanic eruption? As the answer hurtles towards us with increasing urgency, we have now reached the final countdown. What wipes out human civilization will be the most mundane reason of all: our greed. It is not an issue for future generations. It is not an issue we can talk about in 10-15 years. The problem is here, and the problem is now. If we do not act now, there’ll be nothing to act on later. At the end, when the dust settles, the Earth will be completely fine; it’s us that will be nowhere to be seen. This February, come play your part in saving the world. Because no matter what plans you have- there is no Planet B."

ecosoc-agenda-text: "International Refugee Crisis: Modifying Laws and Structuring Enforcement"
about-ecosoc-text: "ECOSOC (United Nations Economic and Social Council), one of the six main organs of the United Nations established by the UN Charter..."
ecosoc-popup-text-about: "The working of the Economic and Social Council includes coordination of fourteen UN specialized agencies, ten functional commissions, and five regional commissions. Its purview extends over 70 percent of the human and financial resources of the entire UN system. The Council consists of 54 member states which are elected by the General Assembly for three-year terms. The Council holds a four-week substantive session each July, alternating between New York and Geneva. "
ecosoc-popup-text-agenda: "Refugees and displaced people have their human rights in a state of constant turmoil due to incidents naturally occurring or artificially created. The laws and directives that govern the international community regarding refugees and the ongoing crisis are outdated, and consist of multiple loopholes. Due to this, the refugees go through immense hardship in escaping severe conditions and attaining refugee status, all the while continuously on the run. Another major source of concern is the state of enforcement that these laws are in. In todays world, there is no binding authority which makes sure that the refugees are in humane situations. This injustice has to come to an end. Join the debate, and be a part of the discussion over one of the world’s most controversial events in the recent past."

about-wto-text: "ECOSOC (United Nations Economic and Social Council), one of the six main organs of the United Nations established by the UN Charter..."
wto-popup-text-agenda: "The featured council of Edition X, this is the stage for the bigs. Introduced with this edition, the featured committee rakes in the brass of substantial debate in and around the circuit and pits them up against one another to heave it out in the most politically technical, lobbying intensive and inherently exciting debate. Such a committe wouldn't just be for one to participate in, it is worth spectating. Therefore developments in the council shall be streamed to the public and updates given to the other councils, while in action. Committee X calls for the most confident of orators and negotiators. Hence, the decoupled application procedure. Please note, only applicants with due experience in debate (primarily in UN simulations, secondarily elsewhere) shall be considered."
wto-popup-text-agenda2: "The Marvel Cinematic Universe is at a crossroads. One that will determine the future of millions of its citizens. It will take only the sharpest political minds and the most eloquent of orators to resolve this crisis. The Sokovia Accords were put forward by the United Nations in 2016 as a means by which the UN could regulate and increase accountability for superhuman activity around the world. Though the basic intent and idea was sound, the Accords themselves were fundamentally flawed, completely ineffective and majorly violated basic human rights. The Accords were seen by many as nothing but a political pipe dream.Now, with new superhumans coming to light all around the world every day, there is an urgent need to create an international set of standards by which superheroes can be effectively regulated for the safety of the public and themselves, while at the same time, ensuring that no human rights and liberties are violated.This February, immerse yourself in a world of fierce debate to work towards creating an effective, humane and implementable set of regulations for enhanced individuals all around the world."
